[12:49]Dread Pirate Tigger: Also single player so it's not like you're inconveniencing anyone else.
[12:49]LadyHawk: yeah crew mechanic as it is is bad enough for me to simply accept that having the good crew the game  can offer is blocked for me, so crew reroll lets me access that
[12:49]LadyHawk: just not gotten round to it yet
[12:50]LadyHawk: for testing purposes where i went 'ah fuck need x' i rerolled one, but testing purposes never get saved
[14:58]Unknownsailor: Can I run bepinex if I've already tweaked a DLL?
[15:06]Absrd: Generally yes, I've experimented with it a bunch and have yet to encounter conflicts.
[15:07]Unknownsailor: I just ran the game and bepinex didnt initialize
[15:48]MartinC: As Absrd said, if you've already modified the .dll manually, it shouldn't be a problem unless you've changed something significant that one of the plugins you install will look for (method signatures for example).  Make sure you download the bepinex version linked in this post: ‚Å†modding‚Å†
[16:19]Unknownsailor: I used 5.4.21, unzipped direct into steam/steamapps/common/starvalor, nothing
[16:21]Unknownsailor: only folder in bepinex folder is core, config isnt written
[16:24]MartinC: x86
[16:24]MartinC: ?
[16:54]Unknownsailor: x64
[16:55]Unknownsailor: oh wait, is star valor 64 bit?
[16:55]MartinC: nop
[16:55]Unknownsailor: ahhh, thats probably it
[16:56]MartinC: yeah probably üòÑ
[16:57]Unknownsailor: ive been using 64 bit OS for so long, I just assume 64 bit by default now üôÇ
[16:58]MartinC: I and several others have done the same üôÇ
[16:59]Unknownsailor: there is goes
[17:02]Unknownsailor: well, crew reroll hasnt crashed the game yet...
[17:11]Unknownsailor: well dang rerolling crew costs lots of money
[17:13]MartinC: You can customise it in the config
[17:13]MartinC: but yeah, I played it safe when I made it.  Probably too safe, but, well, you can customise it in the config üòÑ
[17:14]Unknownsailor: cant go from white to yellow with it, no?
[17:16]MartinC: No, you can re-roll skills and bouses, but you can't change their rarity, level or learning style (specialised, balanced etc.)
[17:24]Unknownsailor: cant mess with unique crew?
[17:53]MartinC: Nah.  Tbf, I probably should have made it optional with the "don't expect to be able to restore them" disclaimer.
[21:50]Dread Pirate Tigger: THere's a setting file for crew reroll. Costs were made high to keep it 'fair' in normal play throughs, as if you were sending them back to be retrained. If you just want the convenience you can get the prices down to like 1-10 credits for everything.
[23:22]Mike C: I have mine set to 1% of standard.
[04:40]Unknownsailor: I knocked off two zeros on the price
[06:07]MartinC: Yeah, the idea was if you spend ages trying to get a crew member to be what you want, you'll earn credits while you're doing it and can use that to tweak them.  Far less of a time saver, more like occasional pity üòÖ .  FYI you can set the prices to 0 or, if you really want, you can make them negative and the mod will pay you for changing crew.  It's not that smart. 
[06:30]MartinC: but yeah, default set up not to change game too much, but you can (hint hint) change it üòâ
[06:31]MartinC: It's like a prize for people who actually read the readme :p
[09:03]MartinC: @NiteTerror https://www.nexusmods.com/starvalor/mods/10 until an official solution is made.  It still requires https://www.nexusmods.com/starvalor/mods/14 to be installed to I'm afraid.  I might rework it to use the new crafting recipe save system at some point, but for now you need both.
[18:20]MartinC: Probably still too jank to let anyone know about it, but it seems to work ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è .

When docked at a station, press the configurable hotkey (default: backspace) to open the auto buy configuration menu on the lobby panel.

Check the box to attempt automatic "full repair" when docking. If you can't afford it, it will just fail with the usual message as if you clicked the button.

For the remaining items, -1 will mean "no action" for an item type. Any other positive whole number will be fulfilled if possible (automatic buying and selling).

The game's "buyX" and "sellX" functions are used, so normal errors should appear. Not tested what happens if you can't afford something.

If the station doesn't stock something i.e. doesn't trade in that thing, a message will appear in the scrolling menu at the bottom right (same place as crew evolution stuff). If the station doesn't have enough of a thing, mod will buy what's available.

[18:21]MartinC: I do plan to put a button to open and close this menu, but I've spent too many hours battling with that task today, so hotkey it is.
[20:21]Laious: Nice!
[09:16]HerpMcderpinstan: is there a way to make gunners shoot rocks while mining?
[09:16]HerpMcderpinstan: derp wrong channel
[09:18]Dread Pirate Tigger: Actually exactly the right channel in this case.
[09:18]Dread Pirate Tigger: Sec...
[09:19]Dread Pirate Tigger: The spreadsheet has a tab listing various mods hosted on github. But for what you want ...
[09:20]Dread Pirate Tigger: Guide to installing BepInEx. You want the 32 bit version btw.
https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html?tabs=tabid-win

The relevant mod: You just need the one for mining gunners. It sets another attitude per gunner to manual, defense (normal) or mining.

[09:20]Dread Pirate Tigger: @HerpMcderpinstan
[09:21]HerpMcderpinstan: tyty
[09:22]Dread Pirate Tigger: Last I checked it still works, at least as of 2.08. It's one of the few I use since I run big ships a lot.
[01:54]captinjoehenry: Out of curiosity is there any sort of central location with mods for Star Valor?
[01:55]Dread Pirate Tigger: I have a tab on the spreadsheet for mods hosted on github. Not keeping track of stuff like mods on nexus or dll edit mods.
[01:58]captinjoehenry: üëç

[00:31]Dread Pirate Tigger: I only turn it on when I'm mining late game, or don't need iron anymore. üòÑ
[00:32]Dread Pirate Tigger: Also just added it to the spreadsheet, which I thought I'd done ages ago. Derp.
[00:33]MartinC: I hardly use it anymore either üòÖ .  Sometimes when I'm scavenging a ship graveyard to stop picking up energy cells.
[00:33]Dread Pirate Tigger: That's another use yeah.
[00:34]Dread Pirate Tigger: End game hunter swarm farming is another solid use for the filter. I haven't done that for a while though.
[00:35]MartinC: That's why I made it originally before the item was added to the game.  But yeah, same, been a while...
[00:36]Dread Pirate Tigger: If anyone wants my exceptions file. It's set up for mining and faction gear. This going in BepInEx/config

[00:38]Dread Pirate Tigger: I basically added the mine only metals, crystals, relic, drop only gear, crafting stuff like robotics and microchips then every faction specific item.
[00:38]Dread Pirate Tigger: I think you can just comment out stuff you don't want all the time with #
[00:38]MartinC: Boy, sure is a butt load more stuff than I have üòÑ
[00:38]Barblegarb: awesome, thanks!
